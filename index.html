			Tech By Her Accelerator Initiative to Support Female Founders of Tech Startups Launched
		</p>
		<p class="excerpt">
			Tech By Her; a tech accelerator initiative focused on supporting burgeoning female-led tech ventures in Africa to become globally competitive and sustainable brands has been launched in Accra.

		<p class="article">
			Powered by the MEST with the support of Tech Entrepreneurship Initiative, ‘Make-IT in Africa’ program implemented by Deutsche für Gesellschaft Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, the goal of the program is to encourage and motivate females in the tech entrepreneurial space.
			This is its maiden edition and the accelerator is open to ambitious female founders of early-stage tech companies in Ghana, Kenya, and Nigeria and seeks to empower and accelerate the growth of women in the tech entrepreneurship space.
			The 3-month program aims to fuel the growth of female-led businesses by recognizing and maximizing their unique strengths and developing a strong Africa-wide female entrepreneurship community.
			Additionally, it will equip them with tools and resources to enable them to navigate their chosen fields, scale and sustain their businesses in a competitive environment.
			According to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Women’s Report (2019), Sub-Saharan Africa boasts of the highest growth rate of female-run businesses in the world. However, female entrepreneurs, specifically in the Tech space, continue to face daunting challenges such as restrictive social norms, limited access to funding, and working within male-dominated industries which limits their potential.
			In that regard, the Tech By Her Accelerator aims to address the unique challenges of the female tech entrepreneur by providing valuable and strong networking connections in the global start-up community. It also aims to nurture girls to take up courses in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S.T.E.M) while mentoring some of the continent’s most ambitious female entrepreneurs.
			The program will also involve mentoring and coaching of female founders and building an alumni network of successful Tech By Her Accelerator participants who will go on to become ambassadors for other upcoming founders.
			Selected candidates for the program will have access to dedicated business mentors, coaching for personal and entrepreneurial growth and access to an expansive network of industry leaders and experts in the technology industry across Africa.
			<a href="http://bit.ly/techbyher">Applications</a> are therefore invited from African female tech entrepreneurs who are eager to establish a firm foundation and explore new prospects and secure further guidance in their chosen fields.
